    <p>Who doesn't love it. Garlic bread is one of the best foods to ever bless the human race, and you are lucky enough to have myself teach you how to make it. This garlic bread will be the best you have ever had, and I will be showing you two ways of making it. The First method will be crispier whilst the latter will be softer.</p>
    <p>I won't tell you which method is better as it is purely up to personal preference, but as long as you follow the instructions correctly, your garlic bread will be amazing. So let's get right into the steps.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 16-ounce (450 g) loaf Italian bread or French bread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick, 112 g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, smashed and minced</li>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (25 g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method 1 (Toasted)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
        <li>Cut the loaf in half, horizontally. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl. Spread butter mixture over the the two bread halves.</li>
        <li>Place on a sturdy baking pan (one that can handle high temperatures, not a cookie sheet) and heat in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from oven. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over bread if you want. Return to oven on the highest rack. Broil on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast and the cheese (if you are using cheese) bubbles. Watch very carefully while broiling. The bread can easily go from un-toasted to burnt.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, let cool a minute. Remove from pan and use a bread knife to cut into 1-inch thick slices. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 2 (Soft)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
        <li>Make the butter, garlic, parsley mixture as shown in method 1.</li>
        <li>Make 1-inch thick slices into the bread, but do not go all the way through, just to the bottom crust. Put a teaspoon or two of the butter mixture between each slice, or between every other slice if you only want the garlic mixture on one side of the bread.</li>
        <li>Wrap the bread in aluminum foil and heat for 15 minutes in the 350°F (175°C) oven, until the butter has melted and the bread is warmed.</li>
        <li>To serve, remove from foil and present the loaf wrapped in a clean tea towel. Tear off slices to eat.</li>
    </ol>
